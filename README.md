## Description

The goal of this application is to build a list of people in my team.

## Usage

This application can be used to generate list of people in a team for the user. They will need to input the following information for their team: The name, email, position title and id of each employee, as well as some specific information depending on thier specific role. They will need to input the office number for the manager, the GitHub username for any engineers, and the school of any interns.

## What I did

I built a program that uses the inquirer node package to input the information to populate manager, engineer, and intern classes. The program will take the user information and put together a webpage displaying the information for each employee in the team.

## What I learned

I learned about how to use classes and subclasses to create several instances of types of employees.
